# FailureImminent
My first attempt so I assume it is a failure in waiting! Actually no, I know it is!!
I say this with reasonable confidence because failure is my default road to success.
one of the greatest minds ever to grace this earth once said this simple but incredible sentance that has stuck with me for years and helped me when I've felt like giving up.
He said “I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.” ― Thomas A. Edison
With that in mind, I will say this about this project, As it is right now, it is nothing, it does nothing, it is capable of nothing and is destined to be nothing without a little help. I'm in the very early stages of my learning to code journey so I'm not even sure what is possible let alone what I'm capable of.
The only thing that is for certain is that one day it will be something more than the nothing it is now, whether that something is better than nothing or does more than nothing, that is a different question entirely.
When I do decide what I'm trying to achieve other than tha accumulation of knowledge, I will make the neccesary adjustments to this README file and more than likely ask a few billion questions and for a massive amount of help. Until then...
